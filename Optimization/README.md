Install SigmoidalProgramming, which is not a standard package, but can be easily installed from
Github repository as follows:
Enter pkg mode (type ']'  in the REPL)
then type 'add https://github.com/madeleineudell/SigmoidalProgramming.jl' and
run the command.

Then, load the SumBassSolver.jl:
include("SumBassSolver.jl")
using .SumBassSolver

Please see the examples. Sorry I have not saved this as a package yet.
